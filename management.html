      <br>
      <p>1.	What we think is our target audience their problem:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. People don’t put themselves first enough. <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. People are looking too much at their end-goal, they need to live more in the present.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. People should be more true to their own ideas and opinions.</p>
      <p>Problems after the interview: <br>
        People don’t have enough time in their day to spend on themselves.</p>
      <p>2.	Customer segments <br>
        Male and female from 20 till 40 years old. They live in the Netherlands and have a well-paid full-time job. They use the following social media platforms instagram, facebook and tiktok mostly Instagram and have and have screen time averaging 4 hours per day.</p>
      <p>3.	Unique value proposition <br>
        When it is a certain hour the watch gives a signal that you can take one hour to do something for your-self. To take time for yourself. <br>
  <br>
        4.	Solution <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Take on less work from others and only stick to your own tasks <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Try to set smaller goals for yourself <br>
