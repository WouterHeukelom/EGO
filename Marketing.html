	  <h4 class="mt-4">Our campaign</h4>
      <p>Our campaign has been created to convince people that selfishness/egoism is a positive thing. We noticed that way to many, students, friends, family, and people on social media experience stress in their life. We think that If we can come up with a solution to reduce this stress. Their lives will be more relaxed and their health will benefit from this. Therefore the campaign message is that being egositic is what makes you grow!</p>
      <p>We chose the social media platform Instagram. The reason we chose only Instagram is that research showed us that Instagram is a platform used by our entire target audience. "Use of the app slowly drops off with age but stays consistent across both men and women, so if your customers are under 40, then Instagram can’t be ignored" (*Robinson, 2021).&nbsp; Down below on this page you will find all the promotional activities which are executed. We have 4 Instagram posts and 1 Instagram reel (video).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Reach objective</h5>
		<p>By the end of the campaign, we want to have a reach of 1,000 people per social media platform. We didn’t reach our objective, we have a reach of 60 accounts. The reason we didn't reach our objective was because we didn't post enough, later we decided to use hashtags. We noticed when we used hashtags that our reach increased.</p>
      	<h5>Affect Objective</h5>
		<p>By the end of the campaign, we want 10 comments per social media platform from our target audiences that they feel addressed and challenged. We didn’t reach our objective, we think it is because we didn’t have a clear call to action to comment on the posts.</p>
		<h5>Response objective</h5>
		<p>By the end of the campaign, we want 20 people to click on a link which directs them to our website. We didn’t reach our objective, because we didn’t have a call to action to go to the website on our posts. The second response objective was by the end of the campaign, we want 25 people to comment on our posts across all social media. We didn’t reach our objective. It is the same as with the affect objective, we didn’t have a clear call to action to comment on the posts. We could have done it more as a call to action, like "comment below how many times did you put yourself first?. The third response objective is by the end of the campaign, we want 50 likes on our posts across all social media platforms. We didn’t reach our response objective, the most likes we have on a post is 8. One of the reasons is first we didn’t use hashtags and later we decided to use hashtags. We noticed when we used hashtags that our likes and reach increased and it may also have something to do with the fact that we did not post often and consistently.</p>
		   
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>Learning Points We learned that it is important to make a plan and actually stick to it. We also learned that we needed to post more and consistently spread out through the week. We also found out that it was very difficult to get followers outside of the people you know and also especially to interact with the followers. Usually we ask a question under the post, for example. "Did you do something for yourself today?", maybe we could have done it more as a call to action, like "comment below what you did for yourself today''. When we started posting on Instagram we noticed that we didn't have many likes or reach, then we started using hashtags. Because of that we saw that we were getting more likes and a greater reach. In addition, we also started looking at what we can do more than just posts to get a wider reach and more likes, then we created an instagram reel and saw within 3 days that we had more views.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;Expected things&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>- We didnt know how to start and therefore also had difficilty continuing throughout the campaign.<br>
	- The social media promotion itself was a bit vague since we were promoting a product without telling the audience the function.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Unexpected things:</p>
      <p>- It is very challenging to find interaction between the brand and its followers&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	- It is very difficult to gain followers besides close people, like friends, classmates, and contacts in our inner circle. <br>
		  - Instagram posts have a bigger account reach than Instagram reels.</p>
<p>What we would do differently is definitely start earlier, post more and consistently, stick to the planning, make instagram stories so we create interaction with our followers, call to action on our posts. using more hashtags, and make more Instagram reels.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>If the project had continued we would have posted more and consistently during the week. We are posting 2 times a week and now we are going to post 3 or 4 times a week. Also, we are going to play with the times. First we only post in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, but now we also post in the evening at 7 or 9 o'clock. <br>
        <br>
Clear call to action like ‘’comment below how your road to self-growth is going’’ and ''Click the link in our bio for a solution to take more time for yourself''. Also in the Instagram stories a question with a poll, so ‘’Have you already taken time for yourself today?’’ and the followers can click on yes or no. <br>
<br>
A detailed schedule with what we post, when we post it and with the text we want to post it. If the schedule says we post an instagram story at 6:30pm with a question and a poll that we actually do that and not earlier that day.</p>
